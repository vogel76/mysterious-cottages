# Chatynkowo mobile app

The expedition loop of the site as a native app, offline-first: the Atlas
(map of cottages), plaque-code entry (four digits or a QR scan), the story
with its recording, the Kronika (rewards), the leaderboard and a profile.
Expo SDK 57, TypeScript, expo-router, a development client (native modules
are used, so Expo Go cannot run it).

The app owns only its interface, navigation and native adapters. Everything
that is domain logic lives in the shared packages: `@chatynkowo/core`
(content, codes, progress, geography, offline rules), `@chatynkowo/api`
(the Supabase backend) and `@chatynkowo/i18n` (the dictionaries, including
the app-only `mobile` namespace).

## Running

Prerequisites: Node 22, pnpm 11, and for a device build Android Studio
(SDK + an emulator or a USB device) or Xcode on macOS.

```bash
pnpm install                        # from the repository root, once
cd apps/mobile
npx expo run:android                # builds and installs the dev client, starts Metro
npx expo run:ios                    # macOS only
npx expo start --dev-client         # later starts, with the client already installed
```

The native projects (`android/`, `ios/`) are generated from `app.json` by
continuous native generation and are not committed; `expo run:*` creates
them on demand. After changing `app.json` or adding a native module, run
`npx expo prebuild --clean` or simply `expo run:*` again.

Configuration comes from `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` variables in `apps/mobile/.env`
(template: `.env.example`); without the file the app uses the production
Supabase project and `https://www.chatynkowo.pl` as the content origin.

Checks, run from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm check                                          # type-checks every package, incl. the app, plus the conventions script
pnpm --filter @chatynkowo/mobile export:android     # bundles the JS for Android through Metro (no SDK needed)
```

### Android SDK without Android Studio (Linux)

Everything the build needs can be installed from the command line into the
home directory, no root required:

```bash
# JDK 17 (Temurin) into ~/.jdks, then the SDK command line tools into ~/Android/Sdk
sdkmanager --licenses
sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-36" "build-tools;36.0.0" "emulator" \
  "system-images;android-36;google_apis;x86_64" "ndk;27.1.12297006" "cmake;3.22.1"
avdmanager create avd --name chatynkowo --package "system-images;android-36;google_apis;x86_64" --device pixel_8
```

Set `JAVA_HOME`, `ANDROID_HOME` and put `platform-tools`, `emulator` and
`cmdline-tools/latest/bin` on the path. The emulator's x86_64 images need
KVM: `/dev/kvm` must exist (virtualisation enabled in the firmware, the
`kvm_amd` / `kvm_intel` module loaded) and the user must be in the `kvm`
group. `emulator -accel-check` tells you which of these is missing.

Metro is configured in `metro.config.js` to watch the repository root and
to resolve from both `node_modules` directories, which is enough for pnpm's
isolated layout; `node-linker=hoisted` in the root `.npmrc` stays commented
out unless a future native module needs it.

Watching the whole monorepo needs more inotify watches than Linux grants
by default; when edits stop reaching the app (Metro logs no "Bundled"
line), raise the limit or install Watchman:

```bash
sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288   # or: sudo apt install watchman
```

  lib/                   adapters: cached content client, progress + sync-queue storage, Supabase and native
                         sign-in, audio (expo-audio), recordings (file system), maps hand-off, position, reachability

```

## How the data flows

- **Content** (`src/lib/content.ts`, `ContentProvider`): the core content
  client reads the published files (the `packages/content/public` tree, as
  the site serves it) from the site origin; every file is kept
  in AsyncStorage as a `CacheEntry` and served stale-while-revalidate: a
  fresh copy is used as is, a stale one is shown at once and refreshed in
  the background, and with no network the stale copy is final. A cold start
  in airplane mode therefore shows the last known map, stories, rewards and
  code lookup. Only the very first launch needs a connection.
- **Codes** (`src/features/code/useCodeEntry.ts`): the four digits are
  hashed with expo-crypto and matched against the cached lookup on the
  device (`lookupCode` from core); manual entry and the scanner feed the same
  hook. The scanner extracts the code from the QR payload with
  `codeFromScan` (bare digits, or a `kod`/`code` parameter in a link).
- **Progress** (`ProgressProvider`, `src/lib/progress-store.ts`): the local
  Kronika is the source of truth (`StoredState`, the same shape as the site
  and the backend). A discovery runs the core rules, is saved, and lands in
  the sync queue (`SyncQueue`, core `offline.ts`); the queue is pushed with
  `syncFinds` whenever the device is online and someone is signed in, and
  retried on every reconnect. Signing in exchanges finds with the account
  (earliest date wins, nothing is ever removed).
- **Account** (`SessionProvider`, `src/lib/sync.ts`): the Supabase session
  lives in AsyncStorage with URL detection off; token refresh runs only in
  the foreground. Sign-in is native: Google (`@react-native-google-signin`)
  and Apple (`expo-apple-authentication`), both handed to
  `signInWithIdToken`. It is hidden behind `EXPO_PUBLIC_AUTH_ENABLED` until
  the providers are configured in the backend; the app is fully usable
  signed out.

## Native pieces

| Area | Library | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Map | `@maplibre/maplibre-react-native` | the site's fairy-tale map: OpenStreetMap tiles washed into parchment that turn real as the seeker zooms in, teardrop pins gathered into clusters (`supercluster`), the search area around the chosen cottage, the level indicator, reset and search controls, the parchment cottage panel; the same per-country opening frame as the site (`homeCountry` / `homeBounds` in core `geo.ts`); "Navigate" opens the system maps app |
| Position | `expo-location` | only on the locate control, foreground permission, one reading shown as a marker |
| Splash | `expo-splash-screen` | the brand logo on the page colour until fonts and the remembered language are loaded |
| Story audio | `expo-audio` | background playback (`UIBackgroundModes: audio` via its plugin) and lock-screen / notification controls (`setActiveForLockScreen`); a language without a recording falls back to the Polish original when the file fails to load |
| Recordings offline | `expo-file-system` | "Save on this device" downloads the mp3 into the document directory, one folder per language; a saved file plays from disk |
| QR | `expo-camera` | `CameraView` scanning `qr` only; the code goes to the Code tab through `scanResult.ts` |
| Fonts | `expo-font` + `@expo-google-fonts/*` | Cormorant Garamond and Cinzel Decorative, imported per weight; the repository's woff2 files cannot be used natively |
| Locale | `expo-localization` | the device language picks the dictionary and, through `detectCountry`, the map's home country (never geolocation) |
| Country names | `@formatjs/intl-displaynames` | Hermes has no `Intl.DisplayNames`; the polyfill with Polish and English data names a cottage's country in the map panel, as the site does |

Google sign-in on iOS additionally needs the library's config plugin with
the `iosUrlScheme` from the Google Cloud console; add it to `app.json`
`plugins` when the provider is configured (the plugin refuses to run
without the scheme, which is why it is not listed yet). Apple sign-in needs
the capability on the App ID; `ios.usesAppleSignIn` is already set.

## Conventions

- Icons come only from `src/ui/icons.ts`, which mirrors the web vocabulary
  name for name (`CloseIcon`, `ChronicleIcon`, ...) and the `iconSize`
  scale; `phosphor-react-native` is imported nowhere else, and no emoji or
  typographic glyph is used as an icon. `scripts/check-conventions.mjs`
  enforces both as part of `pnpm check`.
- Screens compose the primitives in `src/ui` and never restyle them; the
  tokens in `src/ui/tokens.ts` are the `:root` values of the site's
  `ui.css`, so a colour changes in both files together.
- Every user-facing string goes through i18next: the shared set
  (`packages/i18n/src/shared/`) as the `translation` namespace, the app-only
  set (`packages/i18n/src/mobile/`) as `mobile`, typed so both languages
  stay complete; the site's own strings live in `packages/i18n/src/web/`.
- Domain logic that a screen needs goes to `@chatynkowo/core` first, then
  is consumed here.

## Extending

- A new tab is one `Tabs.Screen` in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` plus its file;
  a new top-level surface (a companion's cottage, say) is one `Stack.Screen`
  in `app/_layout.tsx`.
- Per-user state that must reach the account follows the finds pattern:
  rules in core, a store in `src/lib`, a queue entry in `SyncQueue`, a
  push in `ProgressProvider`.
- The content cache takes any loader: `cached(name, maxAge, loader)` in
  `src/lib/content.ts`.

Not in this iteration, deliberately: analytics, notifications and
geofencing.
